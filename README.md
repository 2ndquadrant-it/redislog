# redislog: shipping PostgreSQL logs to Redis

`redislog` is an extension that allows PostgreSQL to _ship_ log entries to a Redis server, directly in JSON format.

One of the goals of `redislog` is to allow administrators to tap PostgreSQL directly into the [Logstash](https://www.elastic.co/products/logstash) pipeline for real-time monitoring. In such an architecture, `redislog` acts as a "Shipper" component able to send events to a "Broker", such as Redis.

Thanks to hooks made available by PostgreSQL through `elog.c`, `redislog` is a logging facility that generates log events in JSON format and sends them to a Redis server over the network. 

## Requirements

* [Hiredis library](https://github.com/redis/hiredis)
* postgres-devel package (or similar, for the pgxs headers)
* openssl-devel package (or similar)
* A Redis server for data collection

## Installation

The module can be activated by adding the following parameters in
`postgresql.conf`:

    shared_preload_libraries = 'redislog'
    redislog.host = '127.0.0.1'
    redislog.port = 6379
    redislog.key = 'postgres'
    redislog.min_error_statement = error
    redislog.min_messages = warning
    redislog.ship_to_redis_only = true


## Event layout

This is an example of an event JSON document created by `redislog`:

```
{
  "@timestamp": "2015-10-20T15:13:58.042+0200",
  "process_id": 7240,
  "session_id": "56263e15.1c48",
  "session_line_num": 1,
  "session_start_time": "2015-10-20T15:13:57+0200",
  "error_severity": "LOG",
  "hint": "Future log output will appear in directory \"pg_log\".",
  "message": "redirecting log output to logging collector process"
}
```



## TODO

* Ship to multiple Redis servers
* Allow DBAs to specify which fields to include in the JSON object
* ...
